        After run main.cpp, there is a window with a "Open File" widget. Clicking on it, a select file window opens. If you select a file with a suffix that is not csv, a warning box will appear with a message "Invalid file type". If you choose no file, a warning box with "No file selected" will appear. If you select a csv file, a pie chart will appear on the window. And if you get a warning, a question box with "continue?" will appear immediately, if not, it will appear after one second. If you choose "yes", the select file window opens again. If you choose "No", all windows will be destroyed.
